				You've never imagine that we'd choose somewhere, well, <em>normal</em> to get
				married.  And you'd be right, we haven't: we're going to be spending the day
				at the wonderfully-named Crazy Bear Hotel.  Both the ceremony and subsequent
				festivities are all at the same place, so there's no worry about driving
				anywhere after the nuptials.
